# Image Processing Pipeline: Grayscale Conversion and Binarization

## Overview

This project implements a simple image processing workflow using Python and NumPy. It performs two fundamental tasks in computer vision:

1. **Grayscale conversion** using the luminance-preserving formula.
2. **Image binarization** using a fixed threshold.

It serves as a basic example for beginners learning how to work with image data using arrays and matrix operations.

## Features

- Load and display RGB images.
- Convert RGB to grayscale based on human-perceived brightness.
- Apply binary thresholding for image segmentation.
- Visualize each step with Matplotlib.
